# Smartsense Home
SmartSense Home is an innovative project that integrates various sensors with an Arduino to create an automated living space. This smart home system incorporates multiple features for enhanced safety, convenience, and energy efficiency.

Things that you need:
<ul>
  <li>Arduino</li>
  <li>MQ6 Smoke Detector</li>
  <li>PIR (Passive Infrared) Sensor</li>
  <li>LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) Sensor</li>
  <li>Ultrasonic Distance Sensor</li>
  <li>Piezo buzzer</li>
  <li>12V DC Power Source</li>
  <li>2-Channel Relay Boards</li>
  <li>Servo Motor</li>
  <li>Fan Motor</li>
  <li>Light Bulbs</li>
</ul>

Key Features
## 1)Automated Door System
An ultrasonic distance sensor detects approaching individuals. When someone is within range, it triggers a servo motor to open the door automatically. The door closes once the person has passed.

## 2)Motion-Activated Fan
The PIR sensor detects human presence in its vicinity and activates a fan motor in response.

## 3)Smart Lighting
An LDR sensor monitors ambient light levels. In low-light conditions, it activates the lighting system when human presence is detected.

## 4)Gas Leak Safety
The MQ6 smoke detector is connected to a piezo buzzer. It triggers an audible alarm when LPG gas is detected, providing a crucial safety feature.

This project demonstrates the practical application of sensor technology and automation.
